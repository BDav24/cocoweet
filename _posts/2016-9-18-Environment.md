The first step : set a working dev environment.

### Boilerplate

Boilerplate are the easiest solution to try a new set of tehcnologies. I love them to quickly clone
and test a solution. I will use this [one](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate).

Boilerplate are good to test but not to start a new project. I need to understand all the bricks of
the project, I don't need 42 `node_modules` if I want to use only 3 and I want to have the control of
the configuration from scratch. The boilerplate is a good example of something working not a starter.

### Opening a window

I you don't know what Electron is read the [quick start](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start/) from the official doc.

```javascript
import truc from 'ooo';

const x: number = 34;
const y = {width: 400};
```
