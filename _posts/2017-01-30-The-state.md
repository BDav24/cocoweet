title: Managing the application state

Today the common answer would be "the state ? --> Use Redux !!" .. Obviously ! or not :)

I will not criticize Redux in this article, because it is a very good state manager, well documented with a simple Api but **Redux is not simple**. Redux separates 2 concepts, the Action - *the cause* - and the Reducer - *the consequence* -. This separation could be powerful but is mostly misunderstood and often creates only a useless "indirection". Please don't use a library because everyone use it (you should read [this](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367) from Redux author), you need to understand the problem the lib solved before using it, **you need to understand the problem you are trying to solve**.

To go deeper into the state managing we are going to regress on our knowledges and (re)start with a Naive vision of React. Remember the first time you implement your first React Component ..

## Props VS State

That's the first question we ask, in a component what's the difference between state and props ?

#### With State

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jnoleau/f332c869ba5986127930f6d4c8176854.js"></script>

#### With Props

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jnoleau/0305b5431e0ea84dc3a385cc64cd8898.js"></script>

* Each time the state is changed, the component is re-rendered;
* Each time the props is changed, the component is re-rendered;

For the rendering point of view : it's the same ! The render process is just a function transforming state & props `(props, state) => VDOM` .The difference is not based on the renderer but on the component itself, the difference is about **Responsability**.

I omit the use of `<MyButton />` but in fact I have a state in my parent component:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jnoleau/ecb838a4852eaaa8f04d7971eb576ccf.js"></script>

A props is computed on a state higher in the components hierarchy. A statefull component is responsible to manage, to update its private local state.

A simple vision is to consider that props is a read-only parameter while state is a private, local attribute.

## So where does live the state ?

Let's create a very simple application : a month selector.

![Month selector 1](/cocoweet/images/article/state_managing/ms_1.png)

I have one component including its state : the current month, but for UI reason I want to add a "prev" and "next" button.

![Month selector 2](/cocoweet/images/article/state_managing/ms_2.png)

ok I have a problem to solve, I need to refactor my previous component and pull up the state in a parent container. Something like this :

![Month selector 3](/cocoweet/images/article/state_managing/ms_3.png)

Then I want to use this month in another part of my app to display the season associated with this month.

![Month selector 4](/cocoweet/images/article/state_managing/ms_4.png)

I am front of a redundant problem ! Each time I add a feature on my application, I need to refactor my root component and pull up <span style="color:red;">the state</span>.

Another related problem is the <span style="color:purple;">callback chain</span>. Because I need the state on my top component, others components are not able to manage it, they are all stateless so we need a chain to pull up the user interactions. On this very simple example we have only a tree with 3 levels but suppose a real app with a deep tree you will have lengthy chains `onChange -> onChange -> onChange -> onChange -> ..`.

Here we go, **This is the problem we are trying to solve**.

If you focus on the root component you can see it is nothing more than a state manager. it has an attribute, the state, - the *application* state - which is our **Model** and it updates this model on interactions (pulled up by others), like a **Controller** ! this is not exactly the role of React our **View**, so a common idea is to separate this M.C.

## Separate the state manager

If I export only the state which is a plain object, nothing will happens because React needs an explicit `setState` to rerender the tree. I need something to turn the state into something observable : **The Store**. Then I have just to implement the Observer pattern with a generic component, listening to this store (this is the component hidden behind the connect function in `react-redux`).

Each time the state changes, the Store notifies its listeners, the `<Connector />` does a `setState` and the magic happens.

![Store](/cocoweet/images/article/state_managing/store.png)

I am defining a simpler version of Flux, the view connector or anything else in the env calls a function (we can call this function an "Action" but remember this is just a vanilla JS function), this function has direct access to the store Api `setState` and the store notifies its listeners (for example the view) each time the state has been modified.

## Implementation of "Simplux"

The state manager I am describing - let's call it Simplux - is really easy to implement. I could choose to develop it from scratch but I would loose all the community effort around Redux and all the tools. Redux is in fact more generical than Simplux so a smarter way is to use Redux !

I only need to (re)implement the `setState(state)` function. Here is the principle :

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jnoleau/f425d978f9dac67254dbc2d83577cfff.js"></script>

The microlib can be found on npm `npm i --save redux-simplux` (source : [https://github.com/jnoleau/simplux](https://github.com/jnoleau/simplux) )
